  Q. Which branch should I use for my pull request?
  A. Use `master` branch (probably).

  Q. Which branch if my change is a bug fix for Gatsby v1?
  A. In this case, you should use the `v1` branch

  Q. Which branch if I'm still not sure?
  A. Use `master` branch. Ask in the PR if you're not sure and a Gatsby maintainer will be happy to help :)

  Note: We will only accept bug fixes for Gatsby v1. New features should be added to Gatsby v2.
